Introduction</font><br>
<font size="2">DeepSkyStacker is available in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Czech, 
Catalan, 
German, Dutch, Traditional Chinese and Portuguese.<br>
<br>
</font></b>
<font size="2">The way to localize DeepSkyStacker for another language is 
described below.<br>
Basically you will need to translate a set of character strings and send them back to me 
so that I can integrate them in the official release.<br>
<br>
As you will see it is quite easy to do.</font></font></p>
<hr color="#0000FF">
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">Localizing in 
4 steps</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><br>
</b></font>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
<b>Step 1<br>
</b>Download the <a href="../download/DSSGeneric.po">DSSGeneric.po</a> file.<br>
It is a text file that you can edit in any text editor but it is much easier 
to...<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2<br>
</b>...download POEdit which is a free software designed to deal with .po files.<br>
POEdit is available here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poedit.net/">http://www.poedit.net/</a></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Step 3<br>
</b>Translate all the not translated strings contained in the DSSGeneric.po file 
by replacing all the untranslated string 
with the correct translation.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4<br>
</b>Send me the modified DSSGeneric.po file (deepskystacker (at) free (dot) fr) along with 
the language in which the translation is done.<br>
<br>
<b>That's it!</b><br>
I will integrate your translation as soon as possible and will send you a link 
to a new beta version so that you can check that the translation is ok.<br>
As soon as the new localization is validated an official release of 
DeepSkyStacker will be made available for all.</font><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><br>
&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<hr color="#0000FF">
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">What's in for 
you</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><br>
</b></font>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
As you know DeepSkyStacker is a freeware and if you are expecting money  it's definitely not the right place.<br>
<br>
However, I will add a link to the web site of your choice (within reasonable 
limits: no commercial or off topic links) in the Introduction page of 
DeepSkyStacker and in the About dialog of DeepSkyStacker.<br>
<br>
Of course there is a small twist...<br>
DeepSkyStacker is constantly enhanced with new features that need new 
translations.<br>
Most of the time it's only a few translations every few weeks, but sometimes a 
major release might add a bunch of new strings.<br>
<br>
So, even if it's mostly a one shot effort it is also important to maintain 
quality over time and I will need you for it.</font></p>

Localization Guidelines</font><br>
</b><font size="2">Here are some localization&nbsp; guidelines that you must 
follow in order to get a usable localization.</font></font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">\n, \t, \r, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt; or other html tags must be left unchanged. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When something like %s, %d, %ld, %.2f or 
  anything starting with % is in a string it will be replaced by a value at run 
  time. <br>
  It must absolutely be left unchanged and the order in which they appear in the 
  English string must remain the same. <br>
  For example: “%ld stars with mean radius of %.2f” must not be modified to 
  “%.2f mean radius for %ld stars” (I think that you get my drift). <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some strings obviously must not be translated.
  <br>
  For example: &quot;MS Shell Dlg&quot;, &quot;Button&quot;, &quot;Slider1&quot;, &quot;Static&quot; but there might be 
  a few other strings lurking in there. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The localized string should be roughly of the 
  same length as the original string when it is possible. <br>
  However, once the translation is done I will check all the dialog boxes and 
  resize the controls accordingly. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some special care must be taken in order to be 
  as close to the language as possible. <br>
  For example: <br>
  In English Gb means Gigabyte, in French it’s Go… <br>
  In English 12 hr 12 mn 59 s is translated to 12 h 12 m 59 s in French <br>
  In English there is never a white space before a semicolon (:) or a ? or a !, 
  in French there is always one</font></li>
</ul>

<hr color="#0000FF">
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">The Technical 
Side</font></b><font face="Arial"><b><br>
</b><font size="2">I am using
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rclocalizer.tk/">Resource Localizer</a> (a 
very affordable shareware) to keep DeepSkyStacker synchronized in all the 
languages.<br>
Once the initial translation is done, it is used to generate the po files with 
only the new translations for both DeepSkyStacker and DeepSkyStacker Live, to 
integrate the translations back and to resize the dialog controls when necessary 
on a per language basis.<br>
