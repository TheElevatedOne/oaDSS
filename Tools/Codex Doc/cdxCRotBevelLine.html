<p>The class described here replaces my former issue &quot;cdxCBevelLine&quot;.<br>
This class provides the following options:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cdxCRotBevelLine-example.gif" width="342" height="296"
alt="cdxCRotBevelLine-example.gif (5061 Byte)"></p>

<p>Features: 

<ul>
  <li>A bevel line even if user has <em>strange</em> fonts<br>
    (have you ever created a sunken static with a height of 1 for a bevelline and tested your
    program on a machine that has 200% larger fonts ?). </li>
  <li>Text rotates appropiately (usable with any font).</li>
  <li>Reacts properly on WM_ENABLEWINDOW.</li>
  <li>Might be used as an example for my cdxCRot90DC (which you may find in the misc section
    of codeguru's). </li>
</ul>

<p>How to use (in a dialog): 

<ol>
  <li>Add cdxCRotBevelLine.h, cdxCRotBevelLine.cpp, cdxCRot90DC.h and cdxCRot90DC.cpp to your
    project.</li>
  <li>Add a static control to your dialog resource.<br>
    Enter some appropiate text to it.<br>
    If your static's width is greater than its height the bevelline will appear horizontal,
    vertical otherwise.<br>
    If the bevelline is drawn vertically, the text is rotated by 90° degrees by default (left
    hand examples of upper image).<br>
    To modify this, put a &quot;~&quot; in front of your control text (right hand bevels in
    the upper image).</li>
  <li>Change its ID to something like IDC_BEVEL_1, open classwizard and assign a member
    variable, type control (CStatic) to it (&quot;m_wndBevel1&quot; for example).</li>
  <li>Open your dialog class' header file.<br>
    Add #include &quot;cdxCRotBevelLine.h&quot;.<br>
    Find the line &quot;CStatic m_wndBevel1;&quot; and replace the &quot;CStatic&quot; by
    &quot;cdxCRotBevelLine&quot;.</li>
  <li>Compile and run.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:

<ul>
  <li>This class may even be useful to you if you only need horizontal bevels.<br>
    Some people mentioned that it's enough to create a sunken static with a height of 1 (use
    Alt while sizing the control) and to put another text control over it.<br>
    In fact, this will look <u>really</u>&nbsp;strange if the user choosed <em>big</em> fonts
    for his display - the dialog resource will automatically adapt the the newly found font
    and your height of 1 may become 3 or stuff - and suddenly friend user doesn't have a
    bevelline but a sunken static.</li>
</ul>
